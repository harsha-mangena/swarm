# HTMX Frontend Rules

## HTMX Patterns
- Use `hx-get`, `hx-post`, `hx-put`, `hx-delete` for API calls
- Return HTML fragments, not JSON
- Use `hx-swap` to control DOM updates
- Use `hx-trigger` for event handling

## Alpine.js Usage
- Use for client-side state only
- Keep components small and focused
- Use `x-data` for component state
- Use `x-show` and `x-if` for conditional rendering

## Styling
- Use Tailwind utility classes
- Follow design system colors from CSS variables
- Keep components responsive
- Use dark mode as default

## Performance
- Lazy load heavy components
- Use SSE for real-time updates
- Minimize JavaScript
- Optimize images and assets
